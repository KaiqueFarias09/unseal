## 1.2.0 - September 23, 2026

### Added

- EPUB 3 rendition settings, page-list and landmarks navigation, and
  accessibility metadata in the package model.
- Typed book-opening results and typed failures for EPUB metadata updates.
- PDF page extraction diagnostics and comic page semantics for reader clients.
- Standalone Markdown, RTF, PalmDOC PDB, unencrypted eReader PDB, and Plucker
  PDB text parsing, each with format-specific public entry points.
- CHM reading with bounded LZX decompression, HTML topics, resources, and
  hierarchical contents; Sony LRF reading with reflowed text, metadata,
  navigation, and embedded images.
- Direct-JPEG DjVu visual pages, dimensions, and optional uncompressed OCR.
  Common JB2/IW44 image layers return a typed unsupported-format failure.
- KEPUB fixture validation through the existing EPUB parser.

### Reliability and scope

- Added licensed or original fixtures, provenance, malformed-input tests,
  browser coverage, and format-specific size and decompression limits.
- The supported subset and remaining gaps for every new format are documented
  in `docs/format-expansion.md` and the README.

## 1.1.0 - September 19, 2026

Dependency maintenance release. No public API changes.

### Changed

- Upgraded `archive` to `^4.3.0`, `koni_archive` to `^0.9.0`, and `xml` to
  `^7.0.1`, with the corresponding parser migrations.
- Shortened the package description to meet pub.dev conventions.

### Safety and reliability

- ZIP containers with a missing or unreadable central directory now fail with
  `InvalidBookException` instead of decoding to an empty archive.
- ZIP-bomb guards keep bounding decompression during inflation on the
  `archive` 4 streaming API, and explicit directory records in book
  containers keep parsing as empty entries.

## 1.0.0 - September 19, 2026

Initial release of Unseal, a pure-Dart library for parsing ebooks and
producing format-neutral reading data.

### Highlights

- Parses EPUB 2/3, MOBI 6, AZW3/KF8, FB2/FBZ, TXT/TXTZ, HTML/HTMLZ,
  DOCX, ODT, AZW4, CBZ, CBR, CB7, CBC, and PDF.
- Exposes a common `Book` model with metadata, cover data, files, reading
  order, navigation, statistics, and original archive information.
- Provides metadata-only reads, automatic format detection, full-text search,
  locators, EPUB CFI operations, reading progression, portable annotations,
  OPDS parsing, and web-worker support.
- Parses EPUB media-overlay timing, preserves right-to-left progression, reads
  sidecar OPF metadata, and supports MOBI/KF8 navigation, PDF extraction and
  reflow, and comic page ordering.
- Rejects unsupported DRM and encrypted inputs; supported password-protected
  PDFs can be opened with the correct password.

### Safety and reliability

- Uses typed exceptions for empty, malformed, encrypted, and unsupported
  input.
- Bounds ZIP expansion, entry sizes, compression ratios, PDF object nesting,
  and FB2 XML depth to make hostile input fail predictably.
- Rejects symbolic links and unsupported archive compression methods.
- Includes focused regression coverage for malformed and adversarial input on
  the Dart VM and in browsers.
